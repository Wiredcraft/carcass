## What & Why

Carcass and the Carcass Family are tools built for middle to large Node.js projects. Carcass is not a framework. It doesn't assume you have a certain database or handle a certain type of connection. The core of Carcass mainly provides two features.

* "Mixable" and "Mixin" help you do code reuse in a more natural JS way.
* "Register" helps you organise your files.

### Getting started

1. Add carcass to your npm dependencies.
1. Structure your project with the help of "register". Example: https://github.com/Wiredcraft/carcass-couch/blob/master/src/index.coffee
1. Config your project with "Carcass Config". (I'm building an example)
1. Build servers and commands with "Carcass Program".
1. Test your project with the help of "Carcass Monitor".
1. Deploy with your favourite process manager, e.g. forever, pm2.
