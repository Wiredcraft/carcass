## What & Why

Carcass and the Carcass Family are tools built for middle to large Node.js projects. Carcass is not a framework. It doesn't assume you have a certain database or handle a certain type of connection. The core of Carcass mainly provides two features.

* "Mixable" and "Mixin" help you do code reuse in a more natural JS way.
* "Register" helps you organise your files.
