<p>&quot;Mixin&quot; is the major way we do code sharing. It simply merges the attributes from one object to another. For convenient, we prepare the origin objects as &quot;proto&quot;s with each a single purpose and &quot;mixin&quot; them together so we got a full functional object or class. For example we have <code>carcass.register</code> because we do</p>
<pre><code class="lang-js">carcass.mixin(<span class="hljs-built_in">require</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'path/to/register'</span>));
</code></pre>
